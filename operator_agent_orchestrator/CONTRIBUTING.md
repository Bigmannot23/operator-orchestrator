# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!  This project aims to
provide a solid, modular foundation for building operator‑grade workflows.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Write code** that solves the problem and add unit tests.  Follow the
   coding conventions used in the existing files.  Use type hints and
   docstrings where appropriate.
3. **Run the tests** (`python -m unittest discover -s tests`), ensure
   everything passes and run the linters via `pre-commit run --all-files`.
4. **Submit a pull request** and describe your changes.  Include context
   about what problem you are solving, how your changes work and any
   potential trade‑offs.

## Reporting issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue and
include as much information as possible.  Screenshots, logs and small
reproducible examples are very helpful.

## Code of conduct

We expect contributors to follow the same professionalism and operator
principles embodied in the rest of the portfolio: automate, modularise,
focus on end users and always leave the codebase better than you found it.
